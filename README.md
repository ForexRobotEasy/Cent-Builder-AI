# Cent Builder AI

Cent Builder AI is an AI-enhanced forex software developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. This software utilizes advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze past trading conditions and make smart trading decisions.

## Features

- Trend system: The AI can analyze market trends and make trades based on the current market conditions.
- Martingale system: The AI can implement a martingale trading strategy to increase potential profits.
- Stop loss and take profit: The software allows you to set stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk and secure profits.

## How it Works

The Cent Builder AI code is designed to be integrated into the MetaTrader 5 trading platform using the MQL5 programming language. The code includes necessary libraries for trading and AI functionality.

The expert initialization function (`OnInit()`) sets up the trade settings, including the stop loss and take profit levels. It also initializes the AI settings, enabling the trend system and martingale system.

The expert deinitialization function (`OnDeinit()`) is responsible for closing any open trades when the expert advisor is stopped or removed.

The expert start function (`OnTick()`) is called on every tick of the market. It first checks if the AI has analyzed past trading conditions using the `AnalyzePastConditions()` function. If the analysis is complete, it checks the market conditions using the `CheckMarketConditions()` function. If the conditions are favorable, a new trade is opened using the `OpenBuy()` function.
